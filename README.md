# pysearch

Pysearch is an open source library, created with the aim of facilitating the development of projects that aim to carry out searches on the internet.
Through a simple command, the script is able to access the internet and search for the text or input added as a parameter to the function.

I have made a script called "example.py" available in this repository to facilitate the end user's understanding.

For the script to work as a library, just save it in the same folder as your project and then import it directly from your script, using the "import" method.
Don't forget to NOT include the .py, otherwise the library won't be imported and therefore it won't work.

Eg: import pysearch

Hope this helps :)
